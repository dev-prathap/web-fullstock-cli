# **web-fullstack-cli**

`web-fullstack-cli` is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to quickly set up and scaffold full-stack web applications. With this tool, you can create projects with both a backend (Node.js/Express) and frontend (React), streamlining the process of starting a full-stack application.

## **Installation**

### **Install via `npx`**

To use the `web-fullstack-cli` tool without installing it globally, you can use `npx` (comes pre-installed with npm):

```bash
npx web-fullstack-cli create-fullstack-app my-new-project
```

This will generate a new full-stack project inside the `my-new-project` directory.

### **Install Globally (Optional)**

You can install `web-fullstack-cli` globally on your machine, making it available in any directory:

```bash
npm install -g web-fullstack-cli
```

After installing globally, you can create new projects with:

```bash
web-fullstack-cli create-fullstack-app my-new-project
```

### **Install Locally**

To install the tool locally in a specific project:

1. In your project folder, run:

   ```bash
   npm install web-fullstack-cli
   ```

2. Run the tool using `npx`:

   ```bash
   npx web-fullstack-cli create-fullstack-app my-new-project
   ```

## **Usage**

### **Create a New Full-Stack Project**

To scaffold a new full-stack project, run:

```bash
npx web-fullstack-cli create-fullstack-app my-new-project
```

This will create a new project folder (`my-new-project`) and generate both frontend (React) and backend (Node.js) code.

### **Start the Project**

After creating the project, navigate into the project folder:

```bash
cd my-new-project
```

Then start the project using:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start both the backend and frontend servers, typically on `http://localhost:3000` for the frontend and `http://localhost:5000` for the backend.

## **Project Structure**

After running `create-fullstack-app`, the following folder structure is created:

```bash
my-new-project/
│
├── backend/                # Backend code
│   ├── server.js           # Main server file (Express.js)
│   ├── controllers/        # API Controllers
│   └── models/             # Database models
│
├── frontend/               # Frontend code
│   ├── index.js            # Main entry point (React)
│   ├── components/         # React components
│   └── public/             # Static files (images, favicon, etc.)
│
├── package.json            # Project metadata and dependencies
└── README.md               # Project documentation
```

### **Backend (Node.js)**

- The backend folder includes an Express.js server that you can extend with custom routes, controllers, and models.
- Use it as a base for building API endpoints and integrating with databases like MongoDB or MySQL.

### **Frontend (React)**

- The frontend folder includes a React app set up with basic routing and components.
- Extend the components to build your user interface, interact with backend APIs, and create a responsive UI.
